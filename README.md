# Hey there! 👋 I'm [Your Name], an AI aficionado knee-deep in the trenches of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Welcome to my GitHub playground!


## 🚀 In the Code Mines
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of AI, specializing in:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Unleashing the power of algorithms and neural architectures to solve complex problems.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** My final year project was a crucible of RL mastery, showcasing its potency in decision-making realms.
- **Data Science & Analytics:** Taming unruly datasets to extract nuggets of wisdom, wielding tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and Power BI.

## 💻 Code Wizardry
My spells are cast in Python, R, C/C++, and Kotlin.

## 🎓 Teaching the Arcane
I'm not just a practitioner; I'm a sage passing down arcane knowledge through workshops and seminars.

## 🌌 IoT & Hardware Runes
Venturing beyond the ethereal realms of software, I've communed with IoT spirits, wielding Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, and ESP32.

## ⚙️ Connecting the Neural Nodes
