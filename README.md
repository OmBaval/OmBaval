# Hey there! 👋 I'm Om Baval, an AI aficionado knee-deep in the trenches of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Welcome to my GitHub playground!


## 🚀 In the Code Mines
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of AI, specializing in:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Unleashing the power of algorithms and neural architectures to solve complex problems.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** My final year project was a crucible of RL mastery, showcasing its potency in decision-making realms.
- **Data Science & Analytics:** Taming unruly datasets to extract nuggets of wisdom, wielding tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and Power BI.

## 💻 Code Wizardry
My spells are cast in Python, R, C/C++, and Kotlin. As I have done my majority of work in Machine Learning and Deep Learning I have done a lot of work in Python followed by  R in the domain of AI. Additionally, I have written good amount of C++ code for Arduino. As an beginner I had also tried my hands on Android Native develpment and as a result I am known to Kotlin and XML. Apart from these I have  come across HTML, JavaScript, PHP, C and many more...\

## 📜 Certifications

## 🎓 Teaching the Arcane
I'm not just a practitioner; I'm a sage passing down arcane knowledge through workshops and seminars.

## 🌌 IoT & Hardware Runes
Venturing beyond the ethereal realms of software, I've communed with IoT spirits, wielding across various Arduino boards and its programming on Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi and its programming on Rasbian OS, Tiny OS and other Linux based environments, ESP8266, and ESP32. I have developed and programmed several Projects using multiple electrical and electronic components and progrmming them in C++, Embedded C or Python language.
